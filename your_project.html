                            <h3>  Southampton Match Report </h3>
                            <small> Thursday 28th Jan 2021</small>
                            <p width="25%" class="report">We came from behind to claim all three points on the road and make it six games without defeat in the Premier League.

                                The forward line was in excellent form all evening with Nicolas Pepe, Bukayo Saka and Alexandre Lacazette all on target as we gained swift revenge for the weekend's FA Cup defeat here at St Mary's.
                                
                                It was action-packed from the opening whistle. </p>
                                
                                <p>The Saints needed just three minutes to open the scoring, but we should have been ahead even before that. Granit Xhaka released Lacazette into the box, but the Frenchman's low shot was saved by the legs of Alex McCarthy as he bore down on goal.
                                
                                The miss was compounded when the hosts went ahead through a thumping Stuart Armstrong volley from James Ward-Prowse's out-swinging corner. </p>
                                
                            <p> We maintained our intensity though and got on terms through Pepe, who kept his cool inside the box to slide the ball into the corner after being set up by Xhaka.
                                
                                Chances kept coming and it was certainly a more entertaining match than the FA Cup game here just three days ago, with Pepe and Saka seeing plenty of the ball on the wings.
                                
                                The game eventually settled down, though it remained entertaining with both sides pushing men forward.</p>
                                
                            <p>We went into the break in the lead thanks to a wonderful goal from Saka. Lacazette fed the youngster with a perfectly weighted pass, and the England man did the rest – skipping past McCarthy and then calmly rolled the ball home right footed from outside the box. It was his fourth goal in his last six league starts - he is certainly enjoying life on the right wing.
                                
                                It was a much more measured start to the second half. The game was on a knife edge as the hosts began to peg us back.
                                
                                But our third goal killed their impetus. The impressive Cedric found Saka on the opposite flank, and his low cross was converted from close range by Lacazette.
                                
                                Bernd Leno made a superb save from a Ward-Prowse free-kick late on and Rob Holding tackled Che Adams in the area as Southampton made us work until the last minute for the three points that lift us to eighth.
